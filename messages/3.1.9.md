# MarkdownEditing 3.1.9 Changelog

Your _MarkdownEditing_ plugin is updated. Enjoy new version. For any type of
feedback you can use [GitHub issues][issues].

## Bug Fixes

* Fix duplicate Markdown syntaxes (#717)

## New Features

## Changes

* MarkdownEditing no longer disables but augoments ST's default Markdown 
  package. Hence you'll no longer find MarkdownEditing/Markdown syntax.

  This change is required to properly support 3rd-party packages which
  extend default Markdown syntax in ST4.
